                    The location of offshore wind turbines varies and is dependent on several facts. For example,
                     turbines need to be located above the crest levels of the highest waves and in depths that are 
                     suitable for the foundation type, and based on OWFs on the continental shelf, they are located about
                      10km off the coast in water depths of 10m. 
                    In addition, typically offshore wind farms need to be located near onshore transmission substations.

                    Fixed foundations for offshore wind turbines are installed directly into the seabed and are commonly used in 
                    relatively shallow waters. Different types of fixed-foundations are used depending on the depth of the water they 
                    are to be installed in.
                     These foundations are buried deep into the seabed in order to support the tower of the turbine.
