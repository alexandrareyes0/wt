                    The technology used in onshore and offshore wind turbines is mostly the same. Their differences 
                    include position, size, scale, and how the energy generated is transferred. Onshore and offshore wind farms 
                    have their own respective advantages and disadvantages, but their installation is also dependent on geographical 
                    location.

                            Wind speed and direction vary greatly on land due to blockages like buildings, mountains, etc. 
                            Due to this, onshore wind turbines cannot provide consistent power year round. They can only achieve 
                            about 2.5 MW compared to offshoreâ€™s average of 3.6 MW.

                            Since onshore wind farms do not run year round, they require energy

                            Onshore wind farms are completely visible to the communities and businesses they are located near.
                             Wind turbines also create a great deal of noise pollution which can be a hindrance to locals. In addition to this,
                              onshore wind farms may pose a threat to birds.

                    Onshore wind farms are optimal for places without access to the coast, such as states
                     located in the Midwest. The use of windmills onshore allows for the use of renewable energy 
                     despite not having access to the high speed winds offshore. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Onshore wind farms are less expensive due to smaller turbine size and minimal  transportation 
                    for installation/maintenance, but produce less energy than offshore wind farms. Onshore wind 
                    farms are beneficial for inland locations with smaller populations, due to its visual/sound impacts.

                    Due to the high concentration of people who live near the coast, within range to 
                    receive power from an offshore wind farm, approximately 80% of the American population, 
                    it will be extremely beneficial to these communities and to the nation as a whole. Renewable 
                    energy will cause a significant decrease in energy costs every year as more offshore wind farms
                     are installed. Since wind speeds are high out to sea, the energy generated from these wind farms
                      is larger than an onshore wind farm and in turn will be able to provide power to a large number 
                      of homes, businesses, etc..

                In addition, offshore wind farms do not cause major disruptions to local populations due to their 
                distance from shore, and ultimately will benefit these populations in the form of economic expansion.
