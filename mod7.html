                   This course was designed to give anyone without previous knowledge of offshore wind all the components
                   necessary to understand what it is, how it works, and why it is important. <br> <br>
                   Offshore wind is a growing industry that will become more prevelent within 10 years as more products arise 
                   and technology advances. Due to this, it is important to educate the people that this emerging industry will potentiall 
                   effect, which is 80% of the American population. Spreading knowledge of offshore wind will allow for a more seamless
                   implmentation of this new clean energy source.
