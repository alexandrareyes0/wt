                    Wind energy has been a vital tool in the lives of all people as early as 5000 BC. Wind was used as a 
                    propellant for boats, and later used for water pumps used in farms. As time went on and 
                    technology advanced, wind power was spread worldwide and used for a variety of purposes such 
                    as food production in the Middle East, to drain lakes in the Netherlands, and to grind grain in America.
                    Wind is an unlimited resources that has been used for centuries in a multitude of ways, and now offshore
                    wind farms can be used to produce enough electricity to power up to 80% of United States residents along the 
                    coast. This advancement of wind technology has been used in several other nations and has proven to be 
                    an economic and eco friendly form of power production.

                Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the President set a goal of achieving 30 gigawatts of offshore wind 
                energy by 2030. Offshore wind turbines are installed directly into the sea floor in shallow waters, like off 
                the East Coast, but to capture more wind energy offshore wind farms need to be deployed in deeper waters, such as 
                off the West Coast. Floating foundations are necessary for this to be possible, hence why the Department of Interior announced a 
                new goal of 15 GW of floating offshore wind capacity installed by 2035 through the Energy Earthshot ™ Program. To create the Floating
                 Offshore Wind Shot. The Wind Shot is to reduce costs of floating base technologies by 70% to $45 per mWh by 2035.

                Governor Phil Murphy has set a goal of achieving 7.5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035 as a part of
                 the state’s goal of reaching 100% clean energy by 2050. This would mean that New Jersey would generate
                  30% of offshore wind energy off of the East Coast. New Jersey’s geological location in the middle of 
                  the Eastern Seaboard allows for a great amount of offshore wind capacity as well as the potential to 
                  house a hub for manufacturing and staging wind turbines for shipment throughout the OCS.  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  New Jersey awards offshore wind solicitations every two years with three projects underway: Orsted’s Ocean Wind I 
                  (1,100 MW capacity), EDF/Shell’s Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, and Orsted’s Ocean Wind II (2,568 MW combined capacity). 
                  The state will also fund scholarships, workforce development, and several other programs to help overburdened communities. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  New Jersey is constructing the first purpose-built offshore wind marshaling port in the United States called the New Jersey Wind Port. 
                  Manufacturing of wind turbine components as well as marshaling and staging will occur here. In addition to the NJWP, the state is constructing 
                  the Port of Paulsboro where monopile foundations will be manufactured. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, New Jersey has created a supply chain within the offshore wind industry in order to allow established companies to partner with/purchase 
                  from New Jersey-based businesses. This will aid in economic growth within the state.
