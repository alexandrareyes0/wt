                    <h6 class = "left-content">Offshore wind is a renewable and unlimited source of energy that takes advantage of the forceful wind speeds on the high seas to generate electricity and supply it to the main power grid. Due to the lack of barriers, more consistent winds, and the abundance of the resource, offshore wind has the potential to be the main source of power for U.S. cities along the coast. Offshore wind farms consist of several rows of giant structures, called wind turbines, which are installed in relatively shallow water with the means to capture wind power and transform it into electricity. This electricity is sent to offshore substations, via underground cables, and then is sent onshore to power homes, businesses, etc.</h6>

                        <p class = "card-text">Greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid major impacts of climate change. Offshore wind is a clean source of power, as opposed to coal or oil. Implementing offshore wind farms cuts carbon emissions by 30 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The Biden-Harris administration set a goal of 30 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030 which will power 10 million homes and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.

                            In addition, New Jersey solicitations require awardees to $10,000 per MW to research and wildlife monitoring within the given region. This is in an effort to avoid any negative impacts to the inhabitants of the animals at the leased sites.

                            In addition to this, New Jersey has supplied $4 million to community colleges within the state to provide workforce development.

                        <p class = "card-text">About 80% of Americans live in close enough proximity to the coast to receive power generated from offshore wind farms. In addition, since they are located off the coast, away from communities, which eliminates any significant noise or visual impacts to locals. Due to minimal oceanic limitations, wind farms can expand without hindering the population.
                            New Jersey's construction of the New Jersey Wind Port and the Port of Paulsoboro will make New Jersey the epicenter for offshore wind. This will have major economic benefits as well as allowing major partners to develop relationships with local NJ companies, educational institutions, and technical schools in order for them to get involved and benefit immensely.

                        <p class = "card-text">There is a significant wind energy potential of over 2,000 GW of electricity off the coasts of the United States. This is due to stronger and unobstructed winds out to sea. A natural gas lease only produces 34 MWh per acre while offshore wind produces 40.8 MWh per acre. Offshore wind has the ability to produce more electricity than natural gas or onshore wind farms. 
                            By 2030, wind energy is estimated to be 28% cheaper than gas over their respective project lifetimes. This decrease is expected to continue over the next decade.
