Wind turbines are giant structures that transform the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy. This is passed to the offshore substation, through cables, where the voltage is increased. From the substation, it can be sent onshore to a transmission network where it can then go on to provide power to the community.

                        <p>   Offshore wind turbines are massive structures and continue to increase in size as innovation progresses. 
                            Their size allows them to capture more wind power and generate more electricity than a smaller turbine
                             would be able to. <br> <br>

                            The wind blows across the blade causing air pressure to increase on one side while it decreases on the other. 
                            This creates lift and drag which ultimately causes the rotor to spin. <br> <br>
                            Then, the rotor connects to the generator
                            and several gears that speed up rotation and make electricity. <br> <br>
                            The electricity generated within a turbine transformer is then sent, through array cables, to a collection system 
                            called an offshore substation. There, the voltage is increased and transferred onshore.

                    The offshore substation is a vital part of the wind farm. An offshore wind farm can
                     have one or more, depending on its capacity. These substations weigh between 10,000 to 22,000 tons 
                     and consist of a topside deck and are installed with either monopile or jacket foundations. The wind
                      turbines transfer the generated electricity to the offshore substation where its voltage is increased 
                      and stabilized. A maximized voltage ensures minimal electrical losses as it is being sent ashore. The power 
                      is then transmitted through cables buried deep within the seabed called export cables. Export cables connect
                       the offshore substation to its onshore point of connection.
