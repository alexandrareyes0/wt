                    An offshore wind farm requires several prior steps before it can be opened for power generation. Before installation can commence, a series of surveys and studies are done at the site to ensure the introduction of wind turbines is feasible and non disruptive to inhabitants of the surrounding area (including marine life, birds, and people). 
                    <br> <br>
                    Once pre construction surveys are completed, installation can begin. This process includes turbine and substation installation as well as cable laying operations.
                    <br> <br>
                    After construction, the commission phase begins. This consists of a series of tests to ensure the integrity and functionality of the wind farm. Once this phase is complete, the wind farm is handed off to an operations and maintenance team who are able to repair any issues.
                    <br> <br>
                    An offshore wind farm has an average lifecycle of about 25 years. After its life cycle has been completed, there are several options for the farm. These include extending its operational life, repowering, or a full decommission of the wind farm.
